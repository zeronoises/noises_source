[**Surface Noise**](http://www.exilefm.com/programs/surface-noise-17){:target="_blank"} and [**Other Noises**](http://www.exilefm.com/programs/other-noises-18){:target="_blank"} are two non-generic music shows presented by [Zero](zero.md){:target="_blank"} that take alternate turns in the Thursday 21:00 - 23:00 slot (UK time) on [ExileFM](http://www.exilefm.com){:target="_blank"}.  
Each show follows a simple presentation format: three (sometimes more, occasionally fewer) tracks presented as an *interesting* [segue](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/segue-segway-commonly-confused){:target="_blank"} (absolutely **no** beat-matching), with mininal chat between each sequence..

**Surface Noise** exclusively features music from the [Great Big Magic Box Of Sevens](/tgbmbos.md/){:target="_blank"} - which is to say, Zero's extensive collection of seven inch vinyl discs.

You can expect to hear surf, funk, soul, reggae, glam, disco, synth-pop, new wave, bossa nova, post-punk, rock, prog, ska, garage, bluebeat, soul, rockabilly, punk, doo wop, be bop, hip hop, power pop, jazz, klezmer, mariachi, psychedelia, country, rhythm & blues and whatever else he can lay his hands on. Probably not techno, heavy metal or polkas. Probably.

**Other Noises** features music from Zero's digital collection, each show having an arbitrary theme to constrain the selection. This makes sure that there are lots of surprises - little gems that have been buried in the digital vault waiting for release... Early shows didn't have the thematic format and so tended to be a bit self-indulgent.

The range of genres is, if anything, even broader than **Surface Noise**...
